Use :ref:`standard reStructuredText tables <rst-tables>`.  They work fine in
HTML output, however there are some gotchas when using tables in LaTeX: the
column width is hard to determine correctly automatically.  For this reason, the
following directive exists:

.. rst:directive:: .. tabularcolumns:: column spec

   This directive gives a "column spec" for the next table occurring in the
   source file.  The spec is the second argument to the LaTeX ``tabulary``
   package's environment (which Sphinx uses to translate tables).  It can have
   values like ::

      |l|l|l|

   which means three left-adjusted, nonbreaking columns.  For columns with
   longer text that should automatically be broken, use either the standard
   ``p{width}`` construct, or tabulary's automatic specifiers:

   +-----+------------------------------------------+
   |``L``| ragged-left column with automatic width  |
   +-----+------------------------------------------+
   |``R``| ragged-right column with automatic width |
   +-----+------------------------------------------+
   |``C``| centered column with automatic width     |
   +-----+------------------------------------------+
   |``J``| justified column with automatic width    |
   +-----+------------------------------------------+

   The automatic width is determined by rendering the content in the table, and
   scaling them according to their share of the total width.

   By default, Sphinx uses a table layout with ``L`` for every column.

   .. versionadded:: 0.3

.. warning::

   Tables that contain list-like elements such as object descriptions,
   blockquotes or any kind of lists cannot be set out of the box with
   ``tabulary``.  They are therefore set with the standard LaTeX ``tabular``
   environment if you don't give a ``tabularcolumns`` directive.  If you do, the
   table will be set with ``tabulary``, but you must use the ``p{width}``
   construct for the columns that contain these elements.

   Literal blocks do not work with ``tabulary`` at all, so tables containing a
   literal block are always set with ``tabular``.  Also, the verbatim
   environment used for literal blocks only works in ``p{width}`` columns, which
   means that by default, Sphinx generates such column specs for such tables.
   Use the :rst:dir:`tabularcolumns` directive to get finer control over such
   tables.
