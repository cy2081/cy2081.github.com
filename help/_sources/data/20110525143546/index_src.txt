.. confval:: project

   The documented project's name.

.. confval:: copyright

   A copyright statement in the style ``'2008, Author Name'``.

.. confval:: version

   The major project version, used as the replacement for ``|version|``.  For
   example, for the Python documentation, this may be something like ``2.6``.

.. confval:: release

   The full project version, used as the replacement for ``|release|`` and
   e.g. in the HTML templates.  For example, for the Python documentation, this
   may be something like ``2.6.0rc1``.

   If you don't need the separation provided between :confval:`version` and
   :confval:`release`, just set them both to the same value.

.. confval:: language

   The code for the language the docs are written in.  Any text automatically
   generated by Sphinx will be in that language.  Also, in the LaTeX builder, a
   suitable language will be selected as an option for the *Babel* package.
   Default is ``None``, which means that no translation will be done.

   .. versionadded:: 0.5

   Currently supported languages are:

   * ``bn`` -- Bengali
   * ``ca`` -- Catalan
   * ``cs`` -- Czech
   * ``da`` -- Danish
   * ``de`` -- German
   * ``en`` -- English
   * ``es`` -- Spanish
   * ``fi`` -- Finnish
   * ``fr`` -- French
   * ``hr`` -- Croatian
   * ``it`` -- Italian
   * ``ja`` -- Japanese
   * ``lt`` -- Lithuanian
   * ``nl`` -- Dutch
   * ``pl`` -- Polish
   * ``pt_BR`` -- Brazilian Portuguese
   * ``ru`` -- Russian
   * ``sl`` -- Slovenian
   * ``tr`` -- Turkish
   * ``uk_UA`` -- Ukrainian
   * ``zh_CN`` -- Simplified Chinese
   * ``zh_TW`` -- Traditional Chinese

.. confval:: today
             today_fmt

   These values determine how to format the current date, used as the
   replacement for ``|today|``.

   * If you set :confval:`today` to a non-empty value, it is used.
   * Otherwise, the current time is formatted using :func:`time.strftime` and
     the format given in :confval:`today_fmt`.

   The default is no :confval:`today` and a :confval:`today_fmt` of ``'%B %d,
   %Y'`` (or, if translation is enabled with :confval:`language`, am equivalent
   %format for the selected locale).

.. confval:: highlight_language

   The default language to highlight source code in.  The default is
   ``'python'``.  The value should be a valid Pygments lexer name, see
   :ref:`code-examples` for more details.

   .. versionadded:: 0.5

.. confval:: pygments_style

   The style name to use for Pygments highlighting of source code.  The default
   style is selected by the theme for HTML output, and ``'sphinx'`` otherwise.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.3
      If the value is a fully-qualified name of a custom Pygments style class,
      this is then used as custom style.

.. confval:: add_function_parentheses

   A boolean that decides whether parentheses are appended to function and
   method role text (e.g. the content of ``:func:`input```) to signify that the
   name is callable.  Default is ``True``.

.. confval:: add_module_names

   A boolean that decides whether module names are prepended to all
   :term:`object` names (for object types where a "module" of some kind is
   defined), e.g. for :rst:dir:`py:function` directives.  Default is ``True``.

.. confval:: show_authors

   A boolean that decides whether :rst:dir:`codeauthor` and
   :rst:dir:`sectionauthor` directives produce any output in the built files.

.. confval:: modindex_common_prefix

   A list of prefixes that are ignored for sorting the Python module index
   (e.g., if this is set to ``['foo.']``, then ``foo.bar`` is shown under ``B``,
   not ``F``). This can be handy if you document a project that consists of a
   single package.  Works only for the HTML builder currently.  Default is
   ``[]``.

   .. versionadded:: 0.6

.. confval:: trim_footnote_reference_space

   Trim spaces before footnote references that are necessary for the reST parser
   to recognize the footnote, but do not look too nice in the output.

   .. versionadded:: 0.6

.. confval:: trim_doctest_flags

   If true, doctest flags (comments looking like ``# doctest: FLAG, ...``) at
   the ends of lines are removed for all code blocks showing interactive Python
   sessions (i.e. doctests).  Default is true.  See the extension
   :mod:`~sphinx.ext.doctest` for more possibilities of including doctests.

   .. versionadded:: 1.0
