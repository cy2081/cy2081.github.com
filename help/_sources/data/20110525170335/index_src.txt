Doctree elements: line_block, line.  (New in Docutils 0.3.5.)

Line blocks are useful for address blocks, verse (poetry, song
lyrics), and unadorned lists, where the structure of lines is
significant.  Line blocks are groups of lines beginning with vertical
bar ("|") prefixes.  Each vertical bar prefix indicates a new line, so
line breaks are preserved.  Initial indents are also significant,
resulting in a nested structure.  Inline markup is supported.
Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines; they begin with
a space in place of the vertical bar.  The left edge of a continuation
line must be indented, but need not be aligned with the left edge of
the text above it.  A line block ends with a blank line.

This example illustrates continuation lines::

    | Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
    | I'm absolutely skint.
    | But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
      as soon as it comes.
    | Love, Ewan.

This example illustrates the nesting of line blocks, indicated by the
initial indentation of new lines::

    Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

        | A one, two, a one two three four
        |
        | Half a bee, philosophically,
        |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
        | But half the bee has got to be,
        |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
        |
        | But can a bee be said to be
        |     or not to be an entire bee,
        |         when half the bee is not a bee,
        |             due to some ancient injury?
        |
        | Singing...
