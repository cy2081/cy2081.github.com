.. note:: You may set a cross-references label in Document properties window in Baow, then copy and paste to your link place.


Cross-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles.
Basically, you only need to write ``:role:`target```, and a link will be created
to the item named *target* of the type indicated by *role*.  The links's text
will be the same as *target*.

There are some additional facilities, however, that make cross-referencing roles
more versatile:

* You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct
  hyperlinks: ``:role:`title <target>``` will refer to *target*, but the link
  text will be *title*.

* If you prefix the content with ``!``, no reference/hyperlink will be created.

* If you prefix the content with ``~``, the link text will only be the last
  component of the target.  For example, ``:py:meth:`~Queue.Queue.get``` will
  refer to ``Queue.Queue.get`` but only display ``get`` as the link text.

  In HTML output, the link's ``title`` attribute (that is e.g. shown as a
  tool-tip on mouse-hover) will always be the full target name.
