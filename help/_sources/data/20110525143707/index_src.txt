These options influence the epub output.  As this builder derives from the HTML
builder, the HTML options also apply where appropriate.  The actual values for
some of the options is not really important, they just have to be entered into
the `Dublin Core metadata <http://dublincore.org/>`_.

.. confval:: epub_basename

   The basename for the epub file.  It defaults to the :confval:`project` name.

.. confval:: epub_theme

   The HTML theme for the epub output.  Since the default themes are not
   optimized for small screen space, using the same theme for HTML and epub
   output is usually not wise.  This defaults to ``'epub'``, a theme designed to
   save visual space.

.. confval:: epub_title

   The title of the document.  It defaults to the :confval:`html_title` option
   but can be set independently for epub creation.

.. confval:: epub_author

   The author of the document.  This is put in the Dublin Core metadata.  The
   default value is ``'unknown'``.

.. confval:: epub_language

   The language of the document.  This is put in the Dublin Core metadata.  The
   default is the :confval:`language` option or ``'en'`` if unset.

.. confval:: epub_publisher

   The publisher of the document.  This is put in the Dublin Core metadata.  You
   may use any sensible string, e.g. the project homepage.  The default value is
   ``'unknown'``.

.. confval:: epub_copyright

   The copyright of the document.  It defaults to the :confval:`copyright`
   option but can be set independently for epub creation.

.. confval:: epub_identifier

   An identifier for the document.  This is put in the Dublin Core metadata.
   For published documents this is the ISBN number, but you can also use an
   alternative scheme, e.g. the project homepage.  The default value is
   ``'unknown'``.

.. confval:: epub_scheme

   The publication scheme for the :confval:`epub_identifier`.  This is put in
   the Dublin Core metadata.  For published books the scheme is ``'ISBN'``.  If
   you use the project homepage, ``'URL'`` seems reasonable.  The default value
   is ``'unknown'``.

.. confval:: epub_uid

   A unique identifier for the document.  This is put in the Dublin Core
   metadata.  You may use a random string.  The default value is ``'unknown'``.

.. confval:: epub_pre_files

   Additional files that should be inserted before the text generated by
   Sphinx. It is a list of tuples containing the file name and the title.
   If the title is empty, no entry is added to :file:`toc.ncx`.  Example::

      epub_pre_files = [
          ('index.html', 'Welcome'),
      ]

   The default value is ``[]``.

.. confval:: epub_post_files

   Additional files that should be inserted after the text generated by Sphinx.
   It is a list of tuples containing the file name and the title.  This option
   can be used to add an appendix.  If the title is empty, no entry is added
   to :file:`toc.ncx`.  The default value is ``[]``.

.. confval:: epub_exclude_files

   A list of files that are generated/copied in the build directory but should
   not be included in the epub file.  The default value is ``[]``.

.. confval:: epub_tocdepth

   The depth of the table of contents in the file :file:`toc.ncx`.  It should
   be an integer greater than zero.  The default value is 3.  Note: A deeply
   nested table of contents may be difficult to navigate.

.. confval:: epub_tocdup

   This flag determines if a toc entry is inserted again at the beginning of
   it's nested toc listing.  This allows easier navitation to the top of
   a chapter, but can be confusing because it mixes entries of differnet
   depth in one list.  The default value is ``True``.
