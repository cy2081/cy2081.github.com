:Directive Type: "replace"
:Doctree Element: Text & inline elements
:Directive Arguments: None.
:Directive Options: None.
:Directive Content: A single paragraph; may contain inline markup.

The "replace" directive is used to indicate replacement text for a
substitution reference.  It may be used within substitution
definitions only.  For example, this directive can be used to expand
abbreviations::

    .. |reST| replace:: reStructuredText

    Yes, |reST| is a long word, so I can't blame anyone for wanting to
    abbreviate it.

As reStructuredText doesn't support nested inline markup, the only way
to create a reference with styled text is to use substitutions with
the "replace" directive::

    I recommend you try |Python|_.

    .. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around
    .. _Python: http://www.python.org/
