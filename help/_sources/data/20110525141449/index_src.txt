.. rst:directive:: .. only:: <expression>

   Include the content of the directive only if the *expression* is true.  The
   expression should consist of tags, like this::

      .. only:: html and draft

   Undefined tags are false, defined tags (via the ``-t`` command-line option or
   within :file:`conf.py`) are true.  Boolean expressions, also using
   parentheses (like ``html and (latex or draft)``) are supported.

   The format of the current builder (``html``, ``latex`` or ``text``) is always
   set as a tag.
