reST has the concept of "field lists"; these are a sequence of fields marked up
like this::

   :fieldname: Field content

A field list near the top of a file is parsed by docutils as the "docinfo"
which is normally used to record the author, date of publication and other
metadata.  *In Sphinx*, a field list preceding any other markup is moved from
the docinfo to the Sphinx environment as document metadata and is not displayed
in the output; a field list appearing after the document title will be part of
the docinfo as normal and will be displayed in the output.

At the moment, these metadata fields are recognized:

``tocdepth``
   The maximum depth for a table of contents of this file.

   .. versionadded:: 0.4

``nocomments``
   If set, the web application won't display a comment form for a page generated
   from this source file.

``orphan``
   If set, warnings about this file not being included in any toctree will be
   suppressed.

   .. versionadded:: 1.0
