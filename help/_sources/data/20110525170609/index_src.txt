Doctree element: block_quote, attribution.

A text block that is indented relative to the preceding text, without
preceding markup indicating it to be a literal block or other content,
is a block quote.  All markup processing (for body elements and inline
markup) continues within the block quote::

    This is an ordinary paragraph, introducing a block quote.

        "It is my business to know things.  That is my trade."

        -- Sherlock Holmes

A block quote may end with an attribution: a text block beginning with
"--", "---", or a true em-dash, flush left within the block quote.  If
the attribution consists of multiple lines, the left edges of the
second and subsequent lines must align.

Multiple block quotes may occur consecutively if terminated with
attributions.

    Unindented paragraph.

        Block quote 1.

        -- Attribution 1

        Block quote 2.

`Empty comments`_ may be used to explicitly terminate preceding
constructs that would otherwise consume a block quote::

    * List item.

    ..

        Block quote 3.

Empty comments may also be used to separate block quotes::

        Block quote 4.

    ..

        Block quote 5.

Blank lines are required before and after a block quote, but these
blank lines are not included as part of the block quote.
